====== acknowledge ======

===== Facts: =====

To acknowledge is to give proper recognition.

  * Acknowledgement can be done simply by means of mental assent.
  * In a fuller sense, a King may be acknowledged by celebrations, pomp and parades.
  * To fully acknowledge and worship God the believer is required to offer himself or herself as a living sacrifice. This does not earn or produce favor with God but rather recognizes that He is worthy of this because He has provided grace to us in Christ Jesus.
